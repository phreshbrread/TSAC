v7.0 - 28/04/2021
- Fixed Circle Area being completely wrong.
- Changed all ".cubed" text to "^3".
- Swapped all Convert functions with TryParse (except in program.cs because I didn't want to).
	- This prevents crashes without having to use try-catch which would take forever and be messy.
	- When inputting an invalid value it will default to 0 instead of crashing.
